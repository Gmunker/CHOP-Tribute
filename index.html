        <h4>History</h4>

        <p>In 1855, Philadelphia had a population of about 460,000, and recorded 10,507 deaths. Leading causes of death were smallpox, typhoid, and scarlet fever. In the worst month of 1855, 300 children under 12 years old died, primarily of infectious diseases. A Philadelphia physician, Dr. Francis West Lewis, inspired by a visit to the new Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London (founded 1852), enlisted Drs. T. Hewson Bache and R.A.F. Penrose to found the first children's hospital in North America.</p>

              <b>1855</b> - On November 23, 1855 the following small advertisement appeared in the Philadelphia Public Ledger:
            <blockquote>
              <small>The Children's Hospital—located on Blight Street, running from Pine to Lombard, below Broad, is now open for the reception of Patients. Children suffering from Acute Diseases and Accidents will be received free of charge. A dispensary, for sick children, is also attached to the Hospital and will be open at the same place every day, (Sundays excepted from 11 to 12 o'clock, when advice and medicine will be given free of charge.)
              </small>
            </blockquote> The first location of the original Children's Hospital was a small building on Blight Street (now Watts St). The hospital consisted of 12 beds and a dispensary. That year they recorded 67 inpatient admissions and 306 outpatient visits.

          The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is in Philadelphia's University City neighborhood, and since 2001 has been undergoing a $1.5 billion expansion that has doubled the hospital's size, while also building more than one million square feet of new research and outpatient facilities on a large, eight acre site south of the main hospital on Civic Center Boulevard. The South Campus expansion includes the eleven-story Colket Translational Research Building, which will provide lab space for the Center for Childhood Cancer Research and the Center for Cellular and Molecular Therapeutics. The new South Campus will also include an underground parking garage and an ambulatory care building with outpatient services.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This South Campus expansion adjoins the University of Pennsylvania Health System's construction of the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine and Roberts Proton Therapy Center.</p>

      <p>This project was supposed to be just a first step into my new career field, to essentially show how to do a quick basic layout with HTML / CSS utilizing Bootstrap. I was asked to make a tribute page, I could not in good conscience choose some random movie star or band.</p>
      <p>I wanted this to mean something to me, so I spent 2 days on something that took me just about 1 hour to make in total. I could not decide if I wanted to do it on Dr. Spray, or the staff of the hospital, or even just my Son and all he has gone through. In the end I decided on the hospital in a whole. Without the facility and the pioneering founding fathers who opened the doors in the first place, who knows what would have become of Nathan..</p>
      <p>It’s unlikely this will ever reach the hospital, the staff or Dr. Spray, but thank you for giving my Son a chance. </p>

    <p>It is my hope that this facility will need to be closed due to no more sick children ever, but that is not reality. Because of reality, and if you ever find yourself in need of special child care, know that CHOP is the leader from mine and my families experiences.
